# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  Finally, summarize how the data differs by city type and how the differences can be used by decision-makers.

### Summary DataFrame

The data for totals by city type are what can be expected.  The DataFrame is in order from least population density to most.  As the density increases, the total rides, drivers, and fares also increase.

However, the averages are the opposite.  They decrease as the type of city increases in population density.  This may be due to drivers neededing to go further between destinations in the rural and suburban city types.  Also, with there being less drivers in these areas, the supply of drivers is such that they can charge more for their rides.
