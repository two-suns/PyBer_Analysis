# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  Finally, summarize how the data differs by city type and how the differences can be used by decision-makers.
## Results
### Summary DataFrame

The data for totals by city type are what can be expected.  The DataFrame is in order from least population density to most.  As the density increases, the total rides, drivers, and fares also increase.

However, the averages are the opposite.  They decrease as the type of city increases in population density.  This may be due to drivers neededing to go further between destinations in the rural and suburban city types.  Also, with there being less drivers in these areas, the supply of drivers is such that they can charge more for their rides.

### Multiple-line Chart

The total fares by city type seem to be fairly consist across the first third of the year.  The urban fares have some jumps around the end of February through March.  St. Patrick's day is in March which could boost the need for people to take rides instead of drive themselves.

## Summary
One recommendation for the CEO would be to increase advertising in rural and suburban areas to attract more drivers and/or more potential customers. This would help increase profits in these areas, and ensure coverage. People in rural areas generally need travel further to get to places.  Therefore, I might suggest that a fare become discounted if the distance of a ride goes over a certain threshold. This might draw in more customers from these areas as they tend to have less disposable income.  Finally, I would suggest an incentive program for customers.  Perhaps a discounted ride after so many rides at full price.
